# FancierZones

Still very experimental, there is a list of todo below, but it is usable as it is.
I'm an ex i3wm user, on Windows I got used to using WindowsGrid, which has been great, however I plan on developing my own tool add some features: span over multiple monitors, gaps between cells, keyboard shortcuts, auto moving into grids.

More polished alternatives are: [FancyZones](https://aka.ms/PowerToysOverview_FancyZones), [WindowsGrid](https://windowgrid.net/), [altdrag](https://github.com/stefansundin/altdrag)

I'll add a built release whenever I considered it beta status.

Todos:

- [ ] Correct offsets
- [ ] Better grid overlay render
- [ ] Drag and resize on the same action
- [ ] Performance overview
- [ ] GUI
- [ ] Customization
- [ ] Bring to spotlight and back
